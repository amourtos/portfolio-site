        Hello and welcome to my portfolio web application, My name is Alex Mourtos, and I am a software engineer. I have been a student
        at Kenzie Academy for the past year. I have built web applications, back-end databases, and other applications utilizing the
        many skills I have acquired at my time with Kenzie Academy. My programming proficiencies include HTML/CSS, Javascript/NodeJS,
        React, Python, and Django, and I continue to work towards growing my language proficiencies every day. I am actively seeking
        employment as a back-end developer or a full stack developer position with a company that is willing to take on junior
        developers that are continuosly willing to learn and advance their career.
      </p>

        Throughout this web application, you will find some of the projects that I had the pleasure of working on as well as more
        details about them and an opportunity to try them out for yourself. I hope you find what you're looking for, and thank you for
        taking the time to look at my creations.
