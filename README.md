Thank you for visiting my personal website! If you are a potential employer, I hope you find what you are looking for as you view a visual representation of my skill set. If you are just visiting, I welcome all feedback and constructive criticisms.

This website is built with core concepts of web applications that I have acquired over the past 6 months attending Kenzie Academy's software engineering full stack program. Life is about consistently learning new things and advancement. I consistently strive to be a better developer tomorrow than I am today.

Thank you for checking me out!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
